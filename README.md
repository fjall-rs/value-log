Generic value log implementation for key-value separated storage, inspired by RocksDB's BlobDB [[1]](#footnotes) and implemented in safe, stable Rust.

> This crate is intended as a building block for key-value separated storage.
> You probably want to use https://github.com/fjall-rs/fjall instead.

## Features

- Thread-safe API
- 100% safe & stable Rust
- Supports generic KV-index structures (LSM-tree, ...)
- Built-in per-blob compression (LZ4, Miniz) (optional)
- In-memory blob cache for hot data - can be shared between multiple value logs to cap memory usage
- On-line garbage collection

Keys are limited to 65536 bytes, values are limited to 2^32 bytes.

## Feature flags

### lz4

Allows using `LZ4` compression, powered by [`lz4_flex`](https://github.com/PSeitz/lz4_flex).

*Disabled by default.*

### miniz

Allows using `DEFLATE/zlib` compression, powered by [`miniz_oxide`](https://github.com/Frommi/miniz_oxide).

*Disabled by default.*

### serde

Enables `serde` derives.

*Disabled by default.*

## Stable disk format

The disk format is stable as of 1.0.0. Future breaking changes will result in a major version bump and a migration path.
